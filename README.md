Executive Data Analysis Report: COVID-19 Infections and Death Toll Worldwide

Overview

The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has had a profound impact on countries worldwide since its emergence in late 2019, with millions of infections and deaths reported.

Characterized by its high transmissibility and wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, COVID-19 has challenged healthcare systems, economies, and societies worldwide. This report presents an analysis of the global COVID-19 infection and death rate, focusing on key trends and patterns. 

Understanding the epidemiology, clinical features, and outcomes of COVID-19 is crucial for effective public health responses and clinical management. 
 
Methodology

The analysis is based on data collected from Our World in Data, Coronavirus Pandemic (COVID-19) - Our World in Data, licensed under the Creative Commons BY license. The dataset includes information on daily infections and deaths, as well as demographic and geographic data.

Project steps:

•	downloading COVID-19 data as csv file from Our World in Data. 

•	Import COVID-19 data into SQL database.

•	SQL Server for data cleaning, aggregation, transformation, and analysis.

•	Tableau for visualization and presentation

Tools:

•	MS Excel

•	SQL Server

•	Tableau 

Total global infections and deaths

•	Total Infections: 150,574,977

•	Total Deaths: 3,180,206

•	Death Rate: 2.11%

Infection and death rate by continent

•	Africa:

•	Total Infections: 4,557,699

•	Total Deaths: 121,784

•	Death Rate: 2.67%

Asia:

•	Total Infections: 39,526,308

•	Total Deaths: 520,286

•	Death Rate: 1.32%

Europe:

•	Total Infections: 44,863,478

•	Total Deaths: 1,016,750

•	Death Rate: 2.27%

North America:

•	Total Infections: 37,529,488

•	Total Deaths: 847,942

•	Death Rate: 2.40%

South America:

•	Total Infections: 24,878,216

•	Total Deaths: 672,415

•	Death Rate: 2.70%

Death Toll

•	The global death rate from COVID-19 stands at over 2.0% as of the latest data.

•	The death toll has been influenced by various factors, including vaccination rates, healthcare infrastructure, and public health measures.

Correlation Analysis

•	A correlation analysis shows a strong positive correlation between vaccination rates and death tolls.

•	Countries with higher vaccination rates tend to have higher death tolls, highlighting the ineffectiveness of vaccines in reducing mortality.

Infection trend and forecast in the United States

•	The graph shows a steady increase in infections from the initial outbreak to the current date.

•	The infection rate peaked in April 2021 with a 9.77% infection rate but has since shown a slight decline.

Infection rate comparison with previous period in the United States

•	Infections March 16, 2021: 8.93%

•	Infections March 22, 2020: 1.00%

•	This shows roughly an 8.00% increase in population infections over a 12-month period.

•	The monthly percentage increase in population infections would be an impressively high 8.30%.

Conclusion

The global COVID-19 pandemic remains a significant public health challenge, with ongoing efforts needed to control the spread of the virus and reduce the number of infections and deaths. Governments, health organizations, and individuals must continue to work together to address this crisis effectively.

Recommendations

•	Continued monitoring and analysis of COVID-19 data to identify emerging trends and hotspots.

•	Implementation of targeted public health measures to reduce transmission and protect vulnerable populations.

•	Collaboration between countries and organizations to ensure equitable access to vaccines and medical resources.

This executive data analysis report provides a comprehensive overview of the global COVID-19 infection and death toll, particularly the infection rate in the United States; it also highlights the dynamic nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and the importance of data-driven decision-making in public health. Further analysis and data collection will be necessary to monitor the evolving situation and inform future strategies.
